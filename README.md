# RSS Feed Generator

In this application, I have created a basic web scraping tool that fetches data from websites. Initially, you should store the website links in a database table to be processed for ingesting the RSS feed.

## Pre-requisite
```bash
1. Java
2. Maven
```
## Run the Application
```bash
1. Import the application into Intellij and run the FeedApplication.java class
2. Run using the command line - mvn spring-boot:run

```
## Swagger URL
After running the application, you can access the [Swagger API document](http://localhost:8081/api/master/swagger-ui/index.html).
